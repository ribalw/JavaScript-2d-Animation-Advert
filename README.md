Problems:
Following problems were encountered while implementing this coursework.
_•	Creating a seamless scrolling background.
•	Finding and adjusting multiple sprites in the story.
•	Adjusting multiple scenes into the story at a specific time interval.
•	Get the axis to draw objects.
•	Add and adjust several techniques together to build a story.
•	Get RGB values for gradients of sunlight and moonlight effect.
•	Changing scenes at an exact time to create a meaningful scene.
•	Creating and tweening from circle to crescent-shaped polygon.
•	Converting 2d scenes into 3d.
•	Transit objects smoothly._

Special features/functions:
-Scene Transition
  Scene transition has made as smooth as possible by calling functions and methods at the right place and on right time.
-Multiple Background Scrolling
  The background was scrolled from one background to second and scrolling was stopped and started again to change the scene accordingly.
-Multiple Sprites
  Five sprites were used one after other to give an understandable meaning to each scene. Each sprite also has shadow according to the scene as shadow disappears when there is no daylight.
-Particle System Rain
  The rain was created using a particle system with several variations from slow to fast and then fast to slow.
-Transition of Day, Night, and Foggy Scenes
  Transparent Bezier curve was created of the same size as background and filled by a gradient with shading effect of day, night, and dark rainy weather. The transition of day and night effect was supported with tweening of the sun to moon and vice-versa.
-Articulated Object
  The chain of word ‘success’ has been created and articulated to translate and rotate in a particular sequence.
-Tweening 
  Circle-shaped polygon was created to build a sun shape and then it was tweened crescent shape of the moon by running a for loop to each point of another shape.
